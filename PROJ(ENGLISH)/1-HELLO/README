This directory will elaborate how the arm9-compatible code is utilized in simulation and FPGA implementation of a simple uart-outputting-HELLO embeded project.

HELLO_pre.zip    ----   It is a directory attatched by KEIL example project "HELLO".
HELLO_pro.zip    ----   Modify UART interface for simulation and FPGA implementation.
sim_hello.zip    ----   the arm9-compatible code and its testbench file, you can compile them and simulate to output chars in console.
chapter7.zip     ----   A FPGA-implementation project based on Digilent's Nexys3 FPGA board, as a reference.
